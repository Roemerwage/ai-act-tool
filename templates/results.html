<p>This overview shows which software architecture quality attributes must be addressed in your AI system’s design, based on your classification under the EU AI Act.</p>

{% if grouped["Prohibited"] %}
  <div class="alert alert-danger">
    <strong>Your system includes one or more practices prohibited under Article 5 of the AI Act.</strong><br>
    This means that its development or deployment is not allowed within the EU. Please consult legal experts before proceeding.

    <strong>Your system is not classified as high-risk but falls under transparency obligations under the AI Act.</strong><br>
    This includes systems such as general-purpose AI models, chatbots, or systems that generate synthetic content.<br>
    You must comply with Articles 50–52, including informing users that they are interacting with AI and providing public summaries for foundation models.
  </div>

{% elif grouped %}
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>Your system is classified as a high-risk AI system under Title III, Chapter 2 of the AI Act.</strong><br>
    This means it is subject to mandatory requirements such as risk management, transparency, cybersecurity, monitoring, and documentation.

  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <strong>Your system is not currently classified as high-risk, general-purpose, or otherwise regulated under the AI Act.</strong><br>
    No mandatory architectural obligations are imposed under the AI Act. However, voluntary compliance is encouraged under Article 69 and Recital 81.
